# Logo Z

Logo is a programming environment for learners. In school I learned geometry with x and y coordinates for about 4 years before z was introduced. I can remember the flood of curiosity. Was it just an additional variable, or a new plane of existence for the imagination?

The ultimate goal of this program is to bring that same wonder to Logo.
